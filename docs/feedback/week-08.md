#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: -


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes were quite compact, and I believe more was discussed and agreed upon in that meeting. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Good leadership, however, it wouldn't hurt to speak up a little more. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: While the atmosphere is collaborative, there did not seem to be a lot of room for free discussions and many members were passive for a lot of the meeting. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The app looks good, but do not underestimate the efforts still required to link up those loose backend features to the frontend. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Nobody was obviously left behind but about half of you seemed to have put in significantly more work. Be careful of this, especially in the final stages of the project.
