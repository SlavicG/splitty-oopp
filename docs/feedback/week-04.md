#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Very nice agenda. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: Good summary of last meeting, but no concrete task division was documented. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Great meeting leadership, did not hesitate to tell team members when a segment was being drawn out. Clearly in control and everybody listened. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Meeting seemed significantly lighter than previous weeks. Everybody's input was requested, though as a small point of improvement you could sometimes ask the quieter people in the meeting directly for their input. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Great progress was made, though not everything was merged into main. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Impressed by the ease at which the task division went. Already running out of core issues this early speaks of a high working pace as well as efficient teamwork.
