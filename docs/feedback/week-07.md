- Minute taker: David Gogoana


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda is nice and concise. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Meeting notes are nice and concise, maybe a little too concise, unless that meeting was the short meeting we had. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: As the chair, it wouldn't hurt to speak a little bit louder so that everybody can year you well and you have some natual leadership. Outside of that, being so unsure about what to do or how to continue undercuts your leadership a little bit, so try to come to the meeting with a proposal on what you could do instead of leaving it an entirely open question to the rest of the team.

Feedback: Many constructive discussions, overall quite positive atmosphere.
