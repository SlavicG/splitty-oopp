# Meeting Notes
- We discussed the last part of the code of conduct (commitment).
- We decided on some changes that will be made: minimum effort should be equivalent to a 10, add minute taker responsibilities, mention concrete ways to measure commitment.
- We will organise the tasks in the backlog based on name, importance, estimated time, how to demo and description.
-  We agreed that each sprint will take a week.
- Splitting into teams: We will start from a bigger group and then progressively split it into smaller ones.
- We will follow Oracle Code Conventions
- We agreed on 2 accepts per merge
- We won't have a person responsible only for testing, everyone will write tests by themselves.
- The chair will be the team leader for the following week.
