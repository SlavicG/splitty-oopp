#Meeting Notes
1. We went through which merges should be approved and closed.
2. We assigned the complexity to each issue base on how many steps should be execute to complete them. the values that have been assigned to individual tasks range from 2 to 8 for the most complicated one (Status for week 3). For backend issues the importance is 3 since we have to implement there just 2-4 methods.
It will help us to then during next milestone predict how much time it'll take based on the difficulty of the issues.
3. Set up centralized local data store issue and Set up internationalization issue are the ones that Ilker agreed to finish by friday. Set up internationalization issue was closed a day after the meeting.
4. We set the end of week three as the deadline to finish the entire backend. The same applies to two open issues from the frontend: IssueAdmin View, Set up centralized local data store and one from the commons: Add WebSocket Event objects.
5. We agreed that each team member would finish their part of the code of conduct by the end of Thursday. On Friday, during the meeting between classes, we will combine the entire document and send it.
6. During the meeting with the TA, we asked about the format in which we should submit the code of conduct. We got the answer that we could have it written using bullet points. We came to the conclusion that this format suits us best and if we do not manage to achieve the required number of words, we will change it on Friday.
7. We asked TA of knockout criteria because we were not sure how the lines were counted. We received a reply that detailed information on this topic would be published after the meeting.
8. We discussed the grades we received from git assignment. It turned out that there should be a fail/pass.
9. We discussed how we will be able to meet the knockout criteria related to sufficient lines in the coming weeks, once the backend is finished.
10. On Friday, by which we are supposed to finish the backend, we will determine what the group that was mainly responsible for it will implement next.
